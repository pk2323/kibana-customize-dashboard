=== Security Issues
* â€‹Kibana cross site scripting issue (ESA-2017-22): Kibana versions prior to 6.0.1 and 5.6.5 had a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability via URL fields that could allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information from or perform destructive actions on behalf of other Kibana users. CVE ID: CVE-2017-11481
* Kibana open redirect flaw (ESA-2017-23) : The Kibana fix for CVE-2017-8451 was found to be incomplete. With X-Pack installed, Kibana versions before 6.0.1 and 5.6.5 have an open redirect vulnerability on the login page that would enable an attacker to craft a link that redirects to an arbitrary website. CVE ID: CVE-2017-11482

Users should upgrade to Kibana version 6.0.1 or 5.6.5. There are no known workarounds for these issues.

  - In 6.0.0 we accidentally included a breaking change that prevented plugins from supplying custom FieldFormatters. This has been fixed but, also changes the way that they need to be defined. Take a look at the field formatters Kibana supplies to see how you should update your custom FieldFormats.
